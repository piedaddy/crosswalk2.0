// In reality, the green light will not go on right after the pressing of the button. The pedestrians need to wait about 3 seconds before the light goes on. Make the website function in this way.
// It is a bit annoying that you press the button and something happens only after 3 seconds. Put a countdown next to the crosswalk light which will count down from 3 seconds when the pedestrian presses the button. Also, do a countdown when the green light is on from 5 seconds to 0.
// The waiting time for the green light should be somewhat random. Make it so that when a pedestrian presses the button, they will wait a random time between 2 and 6 seconds before the green light goes on. -->
